## What is TypeScript and what are the features provided by TypeScript?

- TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
- It was launched in October 2012 by Microsoft Corporation.
- It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, a language building up on JavaScript.
- TypeScript takes the JavaScript language and adds new features and advantages to it.
- It makes writing JavaScript code easier, cleaner and more powerful.
- But, as a disadvantage TypeScript can't be executed by JavaScript environments like the browser (nor by Node.js).
- TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and it transcompiles to plain old normal JavaScript.
- The TypeScript compiler compiles these new features provided by TypeScript to JavaScript 'workarounds'  (a nicer syntax, an easier way of doing something and it will compile that to a more complex JavaScript snippet).
- TypeScript can't add what is not all possible in JavaScript language, but it can add new features that are simply easier to use.
- TypeScript adds types, which will actually give you as a Developer an opportunity of identifying errors in your code earlier before the script runs and the error occurs at runtime in the browser.
- As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.


## What are the advantages provided by TypeScript?

- TypeScript adds types in data super important, which inturn adds an extra error check that eliminates many unexpected and unnecessary errors.
- We can get next-generation JavaScript features - we can type and write TypeScript in a file and then we can compile it down to JavaScript 'workarounds' which will even work in older browsers (Just the tool Babel is used convert modern JavaScript run in older browsers).
- TypeScript adds Non-JavaScript features like Interfaces or Generics.
- TypeScript also adds meta programming features like Decorators.
- TypeScript is highly configurable.
- Modern tooling and modern IDE's you can get support in Non-TypeScript projects.
